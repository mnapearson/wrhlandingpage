      <h1>HENDERSHOT</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
      Former The End Men frontman Matthew Hendershot is back with a brand new
      tour People have called Hendershot everything from “the love-child of Tom
      Waits and Jack White” to “the rebirth of Joe Cocker” to “a musical fall
      down a flight of stairs with a voice like chocolate melted in an ashtray.”
      The End Men were the premiere Brooklyn, New York modern blues duo that
      released 6 albums, toured Europe 8 times, the USA 6 times since 2010, and
      received the 2016 CXCW Best Performance Award. Now, after three years
      away, Hendershot is back with a unique one-man show that blends new
      material with familiar favorites from The End Men, and ranges from full
      blown amplified rock to boozy blues to intimate acoustic shanties and dark
      banterous tales.
